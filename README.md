# Personal Site
The inception of this site was when I wanted to learn about HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript and used the knowledge to create a website from scratch. In addition, I learned about web-hosting and design techniques such as responsive web design.

This repo contains the source code and tracks as I continue to add and maintain my site
